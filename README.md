## **Getting Started**

### **Clone the Repository**

```bash
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/JasonTeixeira/IaC-Library.git
cd IaC-Library

```

### **Initialize Terraform**

1. Navigate to the desired Terraform configuration folder:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    cd aws/terraform
    
    ```
    
2. Initialize Terraform:
    
    ```bash
    bash
    Copy code
    terraform init
    
    ```
    

### **Deploy Infrastructure Using Terraform**

```bash
bash
Copy code
terraform apply

```

### **Deploy an AWS CloudFormation Stack**

```bash
bash
Copy code
aws cloudformation deploy --template-file aws/cloudformation/vpc_template.yaml --stack-name MyVPC

```

## **Usage Examples**

- **Deploy a VPC on AWS**:
    
    Use `aws/terraform` or `aws/cloudformation` to create VPCs with public and private subnets.
    
- **Create Storage Accounts on Azure**:
    
    Use `azure/bicep` to quickly provision Azure Storage Accounts with Standard LRS.
    
- **Multi-Cloud Networking Setup**:
    
    Utilize `multi-cloud/terraform` for configuring cross-cloud peering between AWS and GCP.
